📘 MVCApp Project Description
MVCApp is a .NET Core MVC application that implements a complete Employee Management
System following a clean architecture and 3-tier structure. The system includes fully 
functional modules for managing employees, departments, and user authentication 
using ASP.NET Core Identity.
===================================
🏗️ Project Structure
The solution is organized into three main projects for a clean separation of concerns:

Demo.PL (Presentation Layer)
Contains the MVC controllers, views, and UI logic.

Demo.BLL (Business Logic Layer)
Includes the application’s core business logic, services, and DTOs.

Demo.DAL (Data Access Layer)
Handles data persistence, database context, repositories, and entity configurations.
